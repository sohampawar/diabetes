# Project: Diabetes Patient Readmission Analysis

EDA was performed on the Dataset to get a glimpse of patients who are readmitted for the Diabetes disease also created a ML model to predict which patients are more likely to readmitted
Using KNN and Decision Tree performed HyperParameter Tuning on this algorithms using GridSearchCV

**Technologies used:-** <br/>
1:- Python <br/>
2:- Pandas (To read data) <br/>
3:- Seaborn (For EDA) <br/>
4:- KNN and Decision Tree (To build ML model) <br/>
5:- GridSearchCV for HyperParameter Tuning
